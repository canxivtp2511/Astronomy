									<h2 class="text-uppercase">Events of Universe</h2>
									<p class="item-intro text-muted">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/Event.jpg" alt="" />
									<h1>What is the universe?</h1>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to estimation of this theory, space and time emerged together 13.799±0.021 billion years ago,[2] and the universe has been expanding ever since. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter.

The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[11][12] Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[13] Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding, since then,[14] and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.[15]

According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter[16] (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 25.8%±1.1% [2015] is dark matter.[17] Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% [2015] of the physical universe.[17] Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of the ordinary matter.[18]

There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.[3][19][20]</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The physical universe is defined as all of space and time[a] (collectively referred to as spacetime) and their contents.[10] Such contents comprise all of energy in its various forms, including electromagnetic radiation and matter, and therefore planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic space.[21][22][23] The universe also includes the physical laws that influence energy and matter, such as conservation laws, classical mechanics, and relativity.[24]

The universe is often defined as "the totality of existence", or everything that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that will exist.[24] In fact, some philosophers and scientists support the inclusion of ideas and abstract concepts—such as mathematics and logic—in the definition of the universe.[26][27][28] The word universe may also refer to concepts such as the cosmos, the world, and nature.[29][30]</p>
			<h1>The 10 must-see night sky events to see in 2021</h1>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Another year of skywatching is upon us, and there's a lot to look forward to in 2021!

Here are the 10 most noteworthy sky events. A close pairing-off between two bright planets, a total and nearly total eclipse of the moon, a great year for viewing the beloved Perseid meteors and a great autumn appearance for Venus are among the celestial highlights that will take place in the new year. 

Of course, Space.com's Night Sky column will provide more extensive coverage of these events as they draw closer. </p>
			<h2>Jan. 3: The Quadrantid meteor shower</h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/1.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">At present, the Quadrantid meteor shower is probably — along with the Geminids of December — the richest annual meteor display but one of the briefest; six hours before and after maximum, these blue meteors appear at only a quarter their highest rates. This year, the maximum of the shower is predicted to occur at 1500 hours GMT. 

Unfortunately, the waning gibbous moon will interfere with observations. Under more favorable conditions you might count several dozen meteors per hour. The Quadrantids' radiant (from where the meteors appear to fan out) is located halfway between the head of Draco and the end of the Big Dipper's handle, high in the northeast sky during the early morning. </p>
			<h2>March 5: Jupiter and Mercury meet</h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/2.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Jupiter and Mercury are barely above the east-southeast horizon during dawn, but this morning they're engaged in a very close conjunction, separated by just 0.35 degrees. Mercury (magnitude +0.1) will sit just to the upper left of much brighter Jupiter (magnitude -2.0); the solar system's biggest planet handily outshines the smallest by a factor of 7.

Binoculars will prove to be most beneficial in making a sighting of these two planets against the bright twilight backdrop about a half hour before sunrise.</p>
			<h2>May 25: Supermoon!</h2>
<iframe width="956" height="538" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIDb8OyWBuE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">On this date at 10 p.m. EDT, the moon will arrive at its closest point to the Earth in 2011: A perigee distance of 222,022 miles (357,311 km) away. A little over 9 hours later, the moon will officially turn full (and undergo a total eclipse. See below). 

The near coincidence of the full moon with perigee will result in a dramatically large range of high and low ocean tides. Any coastal storm at sea around this time will almost certainly aggravate coastal flooding problems. Such an extreme tide is known as a perigean spring tide, the word spring being derived from the German springen — to "spring up," not a reference to the spring season.</p>
			<h2>May 26: Total eclipse of the moon</h2>
<iframe width="956" height="538" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G10m2ZZRH4U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">This total lunar eclipse favors the Pacific Rim, that is, the geographic area surrounding the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Rim covers the western shores of North America and South America, and the shores of Australia, eastern Asia and the islands of the Pacific. Hawaiians get a great view with the eclipse happening high in their sky in the middle of the night.  Across North America, western regions will be able to see the total phase and a part of the closing partial stages before moonset intervenes.  

Central regions will be able to watch the start of the partial stages up to (or almost to) totality before the moon sets. Eastern regions must be content with perhaps a small scallop of darkness appearing on the moon's left-hand edge, or perhaps only a faint shading – the result of the Earth's penumbral shadow. The moon will pass well to the north of the center of the Earth's dark umbra; the uppermost part of the moon will be only 21 miles (34 km) from its outer edge. That's why totality will last only 14.5 minutes.</p>
			<h2>June 10: Ring of fire' annular solar eclipse</h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/5.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">These overnight hours will be the prime time to watch for this, the Old Faithful of the midsummer sky: the Perseid meteor shower.  

The best time to watch will be after the moon sets around 10 p.m. local daylight time, leaving the rest of the night dark for these swift streaks of light. The Perseids produce about one meteor per minute under dark country skies and occasionally will produce outstandingly bright meteors, called fireballs, or exploding meteors, called bolides.</p>
			<h2>Mid-September to end of 2021: The Venus show</h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/6.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The most dazzling of planets starts 2021 in poor fashion. Venus starts low in the southeastern dawn sky; sinks out of sight behind the sun in March and April. Reappearing in the sunset sky, it hangs there at only moderate height — sliding southward and coming gradually nearer and brighter but still setting before the sky becomes fully dark. 

Finally, in mid-September, it remains in view after twilight ends and then in early November it suddenly vaults as if off a springboard into evening prominence, attaining its greatest brilliance in early December and with great fanfare calling attention to itself each evening during the Christmas season before plunging back toward the sun early in 2022.</p>
			<h2>March 5: Jupiter and Mercury meet</h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/2.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Jupiter and Mercury are barely above the east-southeast horizon during dawn, but this morning they're engaged in a very close conjunction, separated by just 0.35 degrees. Mercury (magnitude +0.1) will sit just to the upper left of much brighter Jupiter (magnitude -2.0); the solar system's biggest planet handily outshines the smallest by a factor of 7.

Binoculars will prove to be most beneficial in making a sighting of these two planets against the bright twilight backdrop about a half hour before sunrise.</p>
			<h2>Nov. 19: A near-total eclipse of the moon</h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/7.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">North America is in an excellent position to see this eclipse. It will take place in the predawn hours with the visible stages ending before moonset.  

The moon will slide through the southern portion of the Earth's dark umbra and at greatest eclipse all but 2.6% of the moon's diameter will be immersed in the shadow. Because some of the sunlight striking the Earth is diffused and scattered by our atmosphere, the Earth's shadow is not completely dark. Enough of this light reaches the moon to give it a faint coppery glow. Combined with the remaining uneclipsed yellow sliver, will create what some call the "Japanese Lantern Effect"; a strikingly beautiful sight for the naked eye, or viewing with binoculars or a small telescope. 

The very beginning stages of the eclipse will be visible from the United Kingdom and parts of northern Europe prior to moonset. Eastern Asia and Australia will also see it after moonrise later that evening.</p>
			<h2>Dec. 4: Total eclipse of the sun </h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/8.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The final eclipse of 2021 will be visible only from the icy continent of Antarctica. The path of totality, averaging 265 miles (427 km) wide, will sweep inland south-southwest from the Weddell Sea, passing over Berkner Island and the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, then continuing across West Antarctica, darkening the Executive Committee Range (a mountain range consisting of five major volcanoes), before moving offshore at the Ross Sea.  

For even the most ardent eclipse chaser, this will prove to be a tough assignment, although a few hardy souls did see the last total solar eclipse visible here (in 2003) from the ground, while others overflew this frozen land in commercial aircraft. 

An associated small partial eclipse can be glimpsed from parts of South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana, as well as Tasmania and southern sections of New South Wales and Victoria in Australia and a small slice of southernmost New Zealand and adjacent Stewart Island.   </p>
			<h2>Dec. 13-14: The Geminid meteor shower</h2>
			<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/Event/9.jpg" alt="" />
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Geminid meteor shower is due to reach its 2021 peak during the predawn hours of Dec. 14, when 60 to 120 slow, graceful meteors per hour may be seen under dark sky conditions. The Geminids are among the very few showers that perform well even before midnight, but this year the light of a gibbous moon will hamper pre-midnight observations.

In fact, the moon will continue to be a factor until it finally sets just around 3 a.m. local time. But fortuitously, that's probably the very best time to watch since the constellation of Gemini — from where the meteors appear to fan out — stands nearly overhead. Small and rather faint meteors will likely dominate leading up to their predicted maximum. Then, during and after maximum, bright meteors and even occasional spectacular fireballs should appear.  </p>
			<h1>BigBang</h1>
			<p class="item-intro text-muted">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Big Bang theory is a cosmological model of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution.[1][2][3] The model describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature,[4] and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure.

Crucially, the theory is compatible with Hubble-Lemaître law – the observation that the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth. Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the theory describes a high density state preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning.[5] There is no evidence of any phenomena prior to the singularity. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.[6]

After its initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium – later coalesced through gravity, forming early stars and galaxies, the descendants of which are visible today. Besides these primordial building materials, astronomers observe the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, and the Big Bang theory and various observations indicate that this excess gravitational potential is not created by baryonic matter, such as normal atoms. Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence.[7]

Georges Lemaître first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, which he called the "primeval atom". Edwin Hubble confirmed through analysis of galactic redshifts in 1929 that galaxies are indeed drifting apart; this is important observational evidence for an expanding universe. For several decades, the scientific community was divided between supporters of the Big Bang and the rival steady-state model. In 1964, the CMB was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the hot Big Bang model,[8] since that theory predicted a uniform background radiation throughout the universe. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang, which is now universally accepted.[9]</p>
			<h1>Features of the model</h1>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundances of the light elements, the CMB, large-scale structure, and Hubble's law.[10] The theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The universality of physical laws is one of the underlying principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic.[11]

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but later efforts were made to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine-structure constant over much of the age of the universe is of order 10−5.[12] Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.[13][14][notes 1]

The large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth. If it is indeed isotropic, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the temperature of the CMB. At the scale of the CMB horizon, the universe has been measured to be homogeneous with an upper bound on the order of 10% inhomogeneity, as of 1995.[15]</p>
